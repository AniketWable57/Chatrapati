    name: "Raigad Fort",
    region: "Sahyadri Range",
    yearBuilt: "1656 - Capital Fort",
    garrison: "3,000 soldiers",
    description: "The initial construction of the fort was carried out by Chandraraoji More, a feudal lord who controlled the region of Jawali in the Western Ghats. In 1656 CE, Shivaji defeated Chandraraoji in battle and acquired the hilltop bastion that was known as ‘Rairi’ at the time. Shivaji expanded and renovated the fort significantly, before renaming it as ‘Raigad’ or the ‘royal fort.’ Encircled by deep valleys on three sides, the fort could only be accessed through a steep pathway at the front. Considering the strategic location and imposing size of the fort, Shivaji decided to make Raigad his capital. In 1674 CE, the Rajyabhishek or coronation of Shivaji took place at this fort and it was here that he adopted the title of ‘Chhatrapati’. This event is considered to be a significant development in Indian history because the coronation was not authorized by the Mughal emperor and made a bold statement against Mughal rule. Fifteen years later, the control of Raigad once again changed hands. At the Battle of Raigad in 1689 CE, the Mughal general Zulfiqar Khan attacked the fort and defeated the forces of Rajaram Bhonsle I, the third Chhatrapati of the Marathas. Thereafter, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb renamed the fort as ‘Islamgarh.’ However, by 1707 CE, Fateh Khan - the Peshwa or regent of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, captured the fort and controlled it for the next two decades. At this point, the Marathas managed to wrest away the fort again and retained it till 1813 CE. Meanwhile, the British too, had set their sights on this virtually impenetrable hill fortress. They first targeted the area in 1765 CE but it was not until 1818 CE that they were finally able to take over the fort, after bombarding it with cannons. The British proceeded to pillage and largely destroy the fort after taking over. They referred to Raigad as “the Gibraltar of the East,” comparing its steep, inaccessible and solid nature to the famous monolithic rock formation near the Mediterranean Sea.",
    significance: "Long ago, in the heart of Maharashtra’s rugged landscape, a vision began to take shape. It was the vision of Shivaji Maharaj, a brave and visionary leader who saw the potential of a rocky hill in the Sahyadri mountains. This hill would become the mighty Raigad Fort, a fortress that would stand as a symbol of strength and power. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj understood the importance of having a strong stronghold to protect his people and his kingdom. He chose the site of Raigad strategically, perched high on a hill, with steep cliffs on all sides making it nearly impregnable. With its natural defenses and commanding view of the surrounding countryside, Raigad was the perfect location for a fortified capital.",

      builtBy: "Chhatrapati Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale",
      constructionPeriod: "1656-1674",
      architecture: "The architecture of the fort includes some striking components. After Shivaji seized Raigad, the architect Hiroji Indulkar was asked to construct a number of new public and private buildings. Royal palaces and mansions, a royal mint, three hundred stone houses, several offices, a garrison for thousands of soldiers, and a market spread out over a mile, were some of the new additions to the fort complex. Moreover, water reservoirs, gardens, pillars and pathways were used to embellish the redesigned fort. At present, Raigad boasts of a number of quaint gateways which offer a small glimpse of this past grandeur. The Chitta Darwaja or Jit Darwaja was used to access the fort from the foothills below, while the Khoob Ladha Burj is a strategically placed tower from which assailants on all sides could be spotted. The Maha Darwaja, or the main gateway, was built almost 350 years ago but still retains a magnificent look. It consists of two massive bastions, each measuring about 20 metres in height. Apart from the main gate, a special entrance called the Palkhi Darwaja was created for the royal ladies and queens. The Ranivasa or Queen’s chambers, comprising of six apartments in a row, is located to the right of this gateway. Unfortunately, the entire residential structure is currently in a dilapidated condition. Another interesting structure is the Nagarkhana Darwaja, a three-storey edifice which used to face the royal throne. The platform now houses an octagonal ornate canopy, with a seated image of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj placed above the original location of the throne. The Nagarkhana Darwaja also leads to the Raj Sadar or the hall that was used by Shivaji Maharaj to hold court for the public, as well as to meet nobles and envoys.",

    description: `Originally known as Kondhana, Sinhagad Fort stands as a timeless testament to Maratha valor and military genius. Perched at 1,312 meters above sea level, this formidable fortress witnessed one of the most dramatic battles in Indian history. The fort's capture in 1670 by Tanaji Malusare and his troops remains legendary, where they scaled the steep cliffs using monitor lizards as living ropes. This strategic masterpiece offered commanding views of the Pune region and controlled crucial trade routes through the Sahyadris. The fort's natural defenses included near-vertical cliffs on three sides, making it accessible only through a narrow pathway. Within its extensive fortifications were temples, water cisterns, and military barracks that could withstand prolonged sieges. The famous battle cry "Gad ala pan Sinha gela" (The fort is won but the lion is lost) immortalized Tanaji's sacrifice. Shivaji Maharaj renamed the fort Sinhagad (Lion's Fort) in honor of his brave commander. The fort changed hands multiple times between Marathas, Mughals, and British, each leaving their mark on its architecture. Today, it serves as a popular trekking destination with well-preserved structures including the Tanaji Samadhi and Kali Temple. The fort's military significance extended beyond defense to include intelligence gathering and communication relay. Its strategic position allowed monitoring of enemy movements across the Deccan plateau. The fort's architecture demonstrates sophisticated water harvesting with numerous tanks storing monsoon water. Visiting Sinhagad offers not just historical insights but also breathtaking sunset views over the Western Ghats.`,
